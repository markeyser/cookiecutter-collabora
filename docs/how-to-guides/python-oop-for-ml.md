# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python for Machine Learning Projects

## Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses
objects and classes to structure code in a modular, reusable, and
organized manner. Even in machine learning projects, where we often
leverage powerful libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow,
adopting OOP principles can significantly enhance code maintainability,
collaboration, and reproducibility.

## Why Use OOP in Machine Learning Projects?

1. **Modularity**: Breaking down complex problems into smaller,
   manageable pieces by using classes and methods makes the code more
   modular.
2. **Reusability**: Classes and methods can be reused across different
   parts of the project or even in different projects.
3. **Maintainability**: OOP helps in keeping the code organized, making
   it easier to maintain and update.
4. **Collaboration**: Clearly defined interfaces through classes and
   methods allow multiple team members to work on different parts of the
   project simultaneously without conflicts.
5. **Reproducibility**: Encapsulating functionality in classes and
   methods helps ensure that the code behaves consistently across
   different runs, which is crucial for reproducibility in machine
   learning experiments.

## Example of OOP in Python

Here is an example of how you might use OOP in a machine learning
project. This example includes a simple data preprocessing pipeline
using OOP principles and Google-style docstrings.

```python
class DataPreprocessor:
    """
    A class used to preprocess data for machine learning tasks.

    This class includes methods for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables,
    and scaling numerical features.

    Attributes:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The dataframe containing the data to be preprocessed.
    """

    def __init__(self, df):
        """
        Initializes the DataPreprocessor with the provided dataframe.

        Args:
            df (pd.DataFrame): The dataframe containing the data to be preprocessed.
        """
        self.df = df

    def handle_missing_values(self):
        """
        Handles missing values in the dataframe by filling them with the median value.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: The dataframe with missing values handled.
        """
        self.df.fillna(self.df.median(), inplace=True)
        return self.df

    def encode_categorical_variables(self):
        """
        Encodes categorical variables in the dataframe using one-hot encoding.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: The dataframe with categorical variables encoded.
        """
        self.df = pd.get_dummies(self.df)
        return self.df

    def scale_numerical_features(self):
        """
        Scales numerical features in the dataframe using standard scaling.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: The dataframe with numerical features scaled.
        """
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        self.df[self.df.columns] = scaler.fit_transform(self.df)
        return self.df

    def preprocess(self):
        """
        Executes the full preprocessing pipeline: handling missing values,
        encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: The fully preprocessed dataframe.
        """
        self.handle_missing_values()
        self.encode_categorical_variables()
        self.scale_numerical_features()
        return self.df

# Example usage
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'age': [25, 30, None, 45],
    'income': [50000, 60000, 70000, None],
    'gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Female', 'Male']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

preprocessor = DataPreprocessor(df)
processed_df = preprocessor.preprocess()
print(processed_df)
```

## Benefits of Using OOP in Machine Learning

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By encapsulating different parts of the
   preprocessing pipeline into methods, each method has a single
   responsibility, making the code cleaner and more understandable.
2. **Extensibility**: New preprocessing steps can be added easily by
   creating new methods within the class.
3. **Testability**: Each method can be tested independently, ensuring
   that each step in the preprocessing pipeline works correctly.
