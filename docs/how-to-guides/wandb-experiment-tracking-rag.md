# Managing and Tracking ML Experiments in RAG Projects Using Weights & Biases

!!! note "Introduction"
    This guide provides instructions on managing and tracking machine
    learning experiments in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    projects using Weights & Biases (W&B), focusing on multiple
    LangChain and LlamaIndex retrievers.

## What You Will Need

- A working knowledge of Git for version control.
- Access to a W&B account and familiarity with its basic features.
- A RAG project setup with multiple LangChain and/or LlamaIndex retrievers.

## Step 1: Setting Up Branches for Each Retriever Family

!!! tip
    **Create a Git Branch**: For each retriever, create a new branch in your Git repository. Name the branch clearly to reflect the retriever it represents.

1. **Initialize the Branch**: Set up your ML environment in this branch, ensuring all necessary dependencies are installed.

## Step 2: Integrating Weights & Biases

1. **Initialize W&B**: In your project code, add the W&B initialization script at the beginning. This includes setting your W&B project name.
2. **Configure W&B Settings**: Assign specific tags or groups in W&B for each branch, corresponding to the retriever family.

## Step 3: Running Experiments and Logging Data

1. **Start an Experiment**: Begin your experiments using the specific retriever in the branch.
2. **Log Parameters and Metrics**: Use W&B's logging functions to record key parameters, metrics, and outcomes from your experiments.

## Step 4: Documenting Your Experiments

1. **Update README**: In each branch, maintain a README file detailing the purpose of the experiments, the parameters used, and any unique configurations.
2. **Code Comments**: Ensure your code is well-commented to explain the rationale behind specific experimental setups.

## Step 5: Reviewing and Comparing Experiments

1. **Use W&B Dashboards**: Regularly review your experiment results using W&B dashboards to compare different runs.
2. **Analyze Experiment Data**: Analyze logged data to identify the best-performing setups and areas for improvement.

## Step 6: Preparing for Branch Transition

1. **Finalize Current Experiments**: Ensure all experiments in the current branch are completed and all data is logged in W&B.
2. **Sync with Git**: Commit and push all changes to your Git repository before switching branches.

## Step 7: Merging Successful Experiments

!!! warning "Selective Merging"
    - **Select the Best Version**: Use W&B to determine which version of
    the retriever was most successful.
    - **Code Review**: Perform a
    thorough code review of the selected version to ensure it meets
    quality standards.
    - **Merge into Production**: Merge the successful version into the production branch in your Gitrepository.

!!! warning "**Handling Unsuccessful Experiments**"
    - If experiments in a branch do not improve the solution, **do not
    merge** this branch into production.
    - Keep these branches for
    reporting purposes to document the experimentation process and
    justify decisions.
