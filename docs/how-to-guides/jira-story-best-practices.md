# Best Practices for Creating JIRA Stories for ML/AI Projects

Creating well-defined JIRA stories is crucial for the success of any ML/AI project. Clear and concise stories help ensure that team members understand the tasks, leading to better planning, execution, and tracking. Here are some best practices for creating JIRA stories in ML/AI projects:

## 1. **Define the Goal Clearly**

- **Objective:** Start with a clear and concise statement of what the story aims to achieve. The goal should align with the projectâ€™s overall objectives.
- **Example:** "Develop a model to predict customer churn with at least 80% accuracy."

## 2. **Include Detailed Requirements**

- **Data Requirements:** Specify the datasets needed, including their sources and any preprocessing steps required.
- **Technical Requirements:** Mention the algorithms, libraries, frameworks, and tools to be used.
- **Performance Metrics:** Define the metrics that will be used to evaluate the success of the task (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

## 3. **Break Down the Task**

- **Subtasks:** Divide the story into smaller, manageable subtasks. Each subtask should represent a specific piece of work that contributes to the story.
- **Example Subtasks:**
  - Collect and preprocess data.
  - Perform exploratory data analysis.
  - Train and validate the model.
  - Deploy the model to production.
  - Monitor model performance.

## 4. **Define Acceptance Criteria**

- **Clear Criteria:** List the conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete. Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and testable.
- **Example:** "The model should achieve at least 80% accuracy on the validation dataset."

## 5. **Provide Context and Background**

- **Context:** Include any relevant background information or context that helps team members understand the importance and scope of the story.
- **Example:** "This model will help reduce customer churn by identifying at-risk customers early, allowing the marketing team to take proactive measures."

## 6. **Link to Related Stories and Documentation**

- **Dependencies:** Link the story to any related JIRA issues or epics to provide visibility into dependencies.
- **Documentation:** Provide links to relevant documentation, datasets, research papers, or other resources that may assist in completing the story.

## 7. **Estimate Effort and Assign Responsibilities**

- **Effort Estimation:** Estimate the effort required to complete the story, using story points or another appropriate metric.
- **Assignees:** Assign the story to the appropriate team member(s) with the necessary skills and expertise.

## 8. **Use Descriptive Titles**

- **Title:** Ensure the story title is descriptive and provides a quick understanding of the task.
- **Example:** "Develop a customer churn prediction model using logistic regression."

## 9. **Add Labels and Components**

- **Labels:** Use relevant labels to categorize the story (e.g., `data-preprocessing`, `model-training`, `deployment`).
- **Components:** If your JIRA project uses components, assign the story to the appropriate component (e.g., `Data Engineering`, `Model Development`).

## 10. **Review and Refine**

- **Review:** Regularly review and refine JIRA stories during sprint planning or backlog grooming sessions to ensure they remain relevant and up-to-date.
- **Feedback:** Encourage team members to provide feedback on stories to improve clarity and completeness.

## Example JIRA Story Template

**Title:**
Develop a customer churn prediction model using logistic regression

**Description:**
Create a machine learning model to predict customer churn. The model should achieve at least 80% accuracy on the validation dataset. This will help the marketing team to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them.

**Requirements:**

- **Data:** Customer transaction data from the last 12 months.
- **Algorithms:** Logistic regression.
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall.

**Subtasks:**

1. Collect and preprocess data.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis.
3. Train and validate the logistic regression model.
4. Deploy the model to production.
5. Monitor model performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The model achieves at least 80% accuracy on the validation dataset.
- The model is deployed to production and accessible via API.
- Model performance is monitored, and results are reported weekly.

**Context:**
This model will help reduce customer churn by identifying at-risk customers early, allowing the marketing team to take proactive measures.
