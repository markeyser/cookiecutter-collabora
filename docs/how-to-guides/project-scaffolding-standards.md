## Note on Shared Configuration Files for ML/AI Projects

To ensure consistency and maintain high standards across all ML/AI
projects, specific files have been pre-configured and included in the
GitHub repository. These files contain settings and configurations that
enforce standardized practices for all developers involved in the
project. As such, these files should not be modified by individual
developers. The pre-configured files help to ensure that everyone
follows the same standards, enhancing collaboration and project
management.

### Files That Should Not Be Modified by Developers

The following files and sections are crucial for maintaining the
project's standards and should not be altered:

#### .vscode Folder Content
The `.vscode` folder contains settings and extensions for Visual Studio
Code to ensure a consistent development environment for all team
members.

#### .github Folder Content
The `.github` folder includes files for repository management, such as
issue templates, pull request templates, workflows, and contributing
guidelines.

#### .devcontainer Folder Content
The `.devcontainer` folder holds configuration files for VS Code Dev
Containers, providing a consistent development environment setup.

#### pyproject.toml Sections
Specific sections in the `pyproject.toml` file are configured to enforce
coding standards and dependencies. These sections should not be
modified:

- **[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]**
- **[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]**
- **[tool.black]**
- **[tool.ruff]**
- **[tool.pymarkdown]**
- **[tool.coverage.report]**

By keeping these files and sections untouched, we ensure that all
developers are adhering to the same standards, which is critical for
maintaining code quality and project consistency. The person who set up
the GitHub repository has included these configurations to streamline
the development process and enforce best practices.

### Summary

- **.vscode Folder**: Contains settings and extensions for a consistent
  VS Code environment.
- **.github Folder**: Includes repository management files and
  templates.
- **.devcontainer Folder**: Provides configuration for VS Code Dev
  Containers.
- **pyproject.toml Sections**: Enforces coding standards and
  dependencies.

These pre-configured files and settings help to maintain uniformity and
high standards across the project, ensuring that all team members follow
the same practices. Therefore, developers should not modify these files.

## Conclusion

Following this standardized folder and file structure will help maintain
consistency and readability across all AI/ML projects, making it easier
for team members to collaborate and manage the project effectively. This
structure ensures that all necessary components are well-organized and
easily accessible.
