# Steps to Move a Prototype from Jupyter Notebook to Production-Ready Python Class

## 1. **Design the Class and Methods**

**a. Identify Functionality:**

   - Review the notebook and identify the main functionalities that need
     to be encapsulated within the class.
   - Group related functions and processes logically.

**b. Define Class:**

   - Create a class that represents the main entity or process of your
     ML/AI project.
   - Ensure the class name is descriptive and adheres to naming
     conventions (e.g., CamelCase).

**c. Design Methods:**

   - Break down the identified functionalities into methods. Each method
     should have a single responsibility.
   - Consider the inputs and outputs of each method and how they
     interact with each other.

**Example:**

```python
class DataPreprocessor:
    """
    A class to handle data preprocessing tasks for ML models.

    Methods:
        __init__: Initializes the DataPreprocessor with data source.
        load_data: Loads data from the source.
        clean_data: Cleans the loaded data.
        transform_data: Transforms the data for model training.
    """

    def __init__(self, data_source: str):
        """
        Initializes the DataPreprocessor with a data source.

        Args:
            data_source (str): Path to the data source.
        """
        self.data_source = data_source
        self.data = None

    def load_data(self) -> None:
        """Loads data from the source."""
        # Implementation
        pass

    def clean_data(self) -> None:
        """Cleans the loaded data."""
        # Implementation
        pass

    def transform_data(self) -> None:
        """Transforms the data for model training."""
        # Implementation
        pass
```

## 2. **Module Naming**

**a. Naming Conventions:**

   - Use meaningful and descriptive names for your module and class.
     Follow PEP 8 guidelines for naming conventions.

**Example:**

```python
# Filename: data_preprocessor.py
class DataPreprocessor:
    ...
```

## 3. **Formatting**

**a. Use Code Formatters:**

   - Use Black to ensure consistent code style. Black formats the code
     according to PEP 8 guidelines, making it readable and maintainable.

**Command:**
```bash
black data_preprocessor.py
```

## 4. **Linting**

**a. Use Linters:**

   - Use Ruff to identify and fix potential issues. Ruff enforces code
     quality by checking for syntax errors, code smells, and enforcing
     coding standards.

**Command:**
```bash
ruff data_preprocessor.py
```

## 5. **Testing**

**a. Write Unit Tests:**

   - Use `unittest` or `pytest` to write tests for each method in your
     class.
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage to catch edge cases and ensure
     robustness.

**Example:**

```python
import unittest
from data_preprocessor import DataPreprocessor

class TestDataPreprocessor(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.preprocessor = DataPreprocessor("data_source_path")

    def test_load_data(self):
        self.preprocessor.load_data()
        self.assertIsNotNone(self.preprocessor.data)

    def test_clean_data(self):
        self.preprocessor.load_data()
        self.preprocessor.clean_data()
        # Add assertions to check if data is cleaned

    def test_transform_data(self):
        self.preprocessor.load_data()
        self.preprocessor.clean_data()
        self.preprocessor.transform_data()
        # Add assertions to check if data is transformed

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## 6. **Commenting and Docstrings**

**a. Add Docstrings:**

   - Use Google-style docstrings for classes and methods. This improves
     readability and helps in generating documentation.

**Example:**

```python
class DataPreprocessor:
    """
    A class to handle data preprocessing tasks for ML models.

    Methods:
        __init__: Initializes the DataPreprocessor with data source.
        load_data: Loads data from the source.
        clean_data: Cleans the loaded data.
        transform_data: Transforms the data for model training.
    """

    def __init__(self, data_source: str):
        """
        Initializes the DataPreprocessor with a data source.

        Args:
            data_source (str): Path to the data source.
        """
        self.data_source = data_source
        self.data = None

    def load_data(self) -> None:
        """
        Loads data from the source.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If the data source is not found.
        """
        # Implementation
        pass

    def clean_data(self) -> None:
        """
        Cleans the loaded data.

        Returns:
            None
        """
        # Implementation
        pass

    def transform_data(self) -> None:
        """
        Transforms the data for model training.

        Returns:
            None
        """
        # Implementation
        pass
```

## 7. **Refactoring**

**a. Improve Code Structure:**

   - Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
   - Apply the Single Responsibility Principle and other SOLID
     principles.

**b. Remove Duplications:**

   - Ensure there are no code duplications and apply the DRY (Don't
     Repeat Yourself) principle.

## 8. **Debugging**

**a. Use Debuggers:**

   - Use debugging tools to identify and fix issues in the code.
   - Utilize breakpoints and inspect variables to trace the execution
     flow.

**b. Logging:**

   - Implement logging to help with debugging in production. Use
     appropriate log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).

**Example:**
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class DataPreprocessor:
    ...
    def load_data(self) -> None:
        """Loads data from the source."""
        try:
            logging.info("Loading data from source.")
            # Implementation
        except FileNotFoundError as e:
            logging.error(f"File not found: {e}")
            raise
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            raise
```

## 9. **Error Handling**

**a. Implement Error Handling:**

   - Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
   - Provide meaningful error messages and log the errors.

**Example:**

```python
    def load_data(self) -> None:
        """
        Loads data from the source.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If the data source is not found.
            Exception: For other generic errors.
        """
        try:
            logging.info("Loading data from source.")
            # Implementation
        except FileNotFoundError as e:
            logging.error(f"File not found: {e}")
            raise
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            raise
```

## 10. **Final Review and Integration**

**a. Peer Review:**

   - Submit the code for peer review to ensure code quality and
     correctness.
   - Use tools like GitHub or GitLab for code reviews.

**b. Integration:**

   - Integrate the code into the main codebase following the branching
     strategy and version control best practices.
   - Ensure all tests pass before merging.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your code transitions
smoothly from a prototype in a Jupyter notebook to a well-structured,
maintainable, and production-ready Python class. This process emphasizes
best practices in software engineering and machine learning, promoting
collaboration and reproducibility in your projects.
