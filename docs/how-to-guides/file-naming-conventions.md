# File Naming Conventions Guide

## Overview

To maintain consistency and readability in our project, we use the
"snake_case" naming convention for all file names. This guide provides a
set of rules and examples to help you name files correctly.

## What is Snake_Case?

Snake_case is a naming convention where each word in a file name is
lowercase and separated by underscores (`_`). This format is easy to
read and avoids issues with different operating systems handling file
names differently.

## Rules for Snake_Case File Naming

1. **Use Lowercase Letters**: All letters should be in lowercase.
2. **Separate Words with Underscores**: Use underscores (`_`) to
   separate words.
3. **Be Descriptive**: File names should be descriptive enough to
   indicate their contents or purpose.
4. **Avoid Special Characters**: Do not use spaces, hyphens, or any
   special characters other than underscores.
5. **Use Consistent Extensions**: Ensure file extensions are consistent
   and appropriate for the file type (e.g., `.py` for Python files,
   `.md` for Markdown files).

## Examples

### Python Scripts

- `data_cleaning.py`
- `config_settings.py`
- `test_data_processing.py`

### Configuration Files

- `project_config.yaml`
- `database_setup.json`

### Documentation Files

- `user_guide.md`
- `api_reference.md`

### Jupyter Notebooks

- `data_analysis_notebook.ipynb`
- `machine_learning_experiments.ipynb`

### Data Files

- CSV files: `sales_data_2023.csv`
- JSON files: `user_profiles.json`

## Tips

- **Keep it Short and Simple**: Aim for clarity but avoid overly long
  file names.
- **Versioning**: If versioning is needed, append the version number at
  the end (e.g., `data_cleaning_v2.py`).
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Avoid repeating the same word unnecessarily in
  file names.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Uppercase Letters**: `Data_Cleaning.py` (Incorrect)
- **Hyphens**: `data-cleaning.py` (Incorrect)
- **Spaces**: `data cleaning.py` (Incorrect)
- **Special Characters**: `data@cleaning!.py` (Incorrect)

By following these guidelines, we ensure that our file names are
consistent, readable, and easy to manage across different systems and
environments.
