# Cookiecutter Collabora

Welcome to Cookiecutter Collabora, a
[Cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/) template engineered for
artificial intelligence, machine learning, and generative AI projects.
This template isn't just a starting point; it's a comprehensive
framework designed to guide you through the intricacies of AI project
development.  It combines best practices, industry standards, and a
suite of tools that aligns with the dynamic needs of modern AI
development.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- **Development Environment**:
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) desktop
  - AWS Cloud Code Editor
  - GitHub Codespaces
  - Any other cloud-powered development environment compatible with VS Code or VS Code Open Source

- **Python**:
  - Ensure Python is installed on your system. This project is compatible with Python 3.x.

## 📖 Usage

### Installing Cookiecutter

Before starting, ensure Cookiecutter is installed on your system:

```shell
pip install cookiecutter
```

### Generate a New Project

Create a new project by running:

```shell
cookiecutter git@github.com:markeyser/cookiecutter-collabora.git
```

You will be prompted to enter details for your project, such as project
name, OS type, author name, and more. For example:

```bash
  [1/9] project_name (Project Name): My AI Project
  [2/9] project_slug (my-ai-project):
  [3/9] package_name (myaiproject):
  [4/9] environment_name (my-ai-project-env):
  [5/9] author_name (Your name or your organization/company/team): Jane Doe
  [6/9] author_email (youremail@example.com): jane.doe@example.com
  [7/9] description (A short description of the project.): AI project development
  [8/9] independent_reviewer (github_username_of_independent_reviewer):
  [9/9] site_name (My AI Project Docs):
INFO:root:Current working directory: /Users/username/Projects/my-ai-project
```

This process will generate a new project with your specific
configurations.

This will create a new project based on the `cookiecutter-collabora` template
with your specified details.

```bash
cd my-ai-project
```

Once you're in your project's directory, you can open the entire
directory in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
code .
```

## 📁 Resulting Directory Structure

### Generate a Project from a Downloaded Template

If you have already downloaded the Cookiecutter template:

#### Listing Installed Cookiecutter Templates

To see installed Cookiecutter templates, use:

```bash
cookiecutter --list-installed
1 installed templates:
 * cookiecutter-collabora
```

#### Locating the `.cookiecutters` Directory on a Mac

Your cloned cookiecutters are usually stored in `~/.cookiecutters/`.

1. **Open Terminal**: Find Terminal in Applications > Utilities, or use
   Spotlight.

2. **Navigate to Home Directory**: Type `cd ~` and press Enter.

3. **List Hidden Directories**: Use `ls -a` to view all files and
   directories, including hidden ones like `.cookiecutters`.

4. **Access the `.cookiecutters` Directory**: Enter `cd .cookiecutters`.

5. **View Template Contents (Optional)**: Use `ls` to view the templates
   in the `.cookiecutters` directory.

   ```bash
   pwd
   /Users/username/.cookiecutters/cookiecutter-collabora
   ```

#### Creating a New Project with a Template

To create a project using the `cookiecutter-collabora` template:

```bash
cookiecutter /Users/username/.cookiecutters/cookiecutter-collabora
```

Enter the details for your project when prompted. For instance:

```bash
  [1/9] project_name (Project Name): My AI Project
  [2/9] project_slug (my-ai-project):
  [3/9] package_name (myaiproject):
  [4/9] environment_name (my-ai-project-env):
  [5/9] author_name (Your name or your organization/company/team): Jane Doe
  [6/9] author_email (youremail@example.com): jane.doe@example.com
  [7/9] description (A short description of the project.): AI project development
  [8/9] independent_reviewer (github_username_of_independent_reviewer):
  [9/9] site_name (My AI Project Docs):
INFO:root:Current working directory: /Users/username/Projects/my-ai-project
```

This will create a new project based on the `cookiecutter-collabora` template
with your specified details.

```bash
cd my-ai-project
```

Once you're in your project's directory, you can open the entire
directory in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
code .
```
