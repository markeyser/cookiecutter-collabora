## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to get you started with the `{{
cookiecutter.project_name }}` right away:

1. **Import the Application class**
   - This class is the core of our package, managing the application
     logic.

```python
from {{ cookiecutter.package_name }} import Application
```

2. **Configure your application**
   - Setup your application's configuration settings. Below is an
     example configuration:

```python
config = {
    'name': '{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}',
    'version': '1.0',
    'environment': '{{ cookiecutter.environment_name }}'
}
```

3. **Create an instance and run your application**
   - Instantiate your application with the configuration and call the
     `run` method to start it.

```python
app = Application(config)
app.run()
```

This example demonstrates how to set up and run a basic instance of the
application using the `{{ cookiecutter.package_name }}` package. For
more detailed usage, refer to our [How-To
Guide](./docs/how-to-guides.md) and [Tutorials](./docs/tutorials.md).
