# Contributing Guide for Service Sage Pilot

Welcome to the {{cookiecutter.project_name}} project! Follow these
guidelines to contribute effectively.

## Guidelines

- **Tools & Standards**: Use VS Code, Python libraries, VS Code
  extensions, and GitHub Actions.
- **Code**: Follow PEP 8, use type annotations, and document with
  docstrings.
- **Testing**: Use pytest for custom code; no need to test well-known
  libraries.
- **Collaboration**: Focus on reproducibility and collaboration over
  optimization.
- **Branching**: Use feature branches; merge successful experiments into
  `dev`.
